# Fail2Ban filter for Authelia
#
# # Make sure that the HTTP header "X-Forwarded-For" received by Authelia's backend
# # only contains a single IP address (the one from the end-user), and not the proxy chain
# # (it is misleading: usually, this is the purpose of this header).
#
# # the failregex rule counts every failed 1FA attempt (first line, wrong username or password) and failed 2FA attempt
# # second line) as a failure.
# # the ignoreregex rule ignores debug, info and warning messages as all authentication failures are flagged as errors

[Definition]
failregex = ^.*Unsuccessful 1FA authentication attempt by user .*remote_ip="?<HOST>"? stack.*
            ^.*Unsuccessful (TOTP|Duo|U2F) authentication attempt by user .*remote_ip="?<HOST>"? stack.*

ignoreregex = ^.*level=debug.*
              ^.*level=info.*
              ^.*level=warning.*
